\section{Work Experience}

\cventry{Aug 2023 - Ongoing}{FPGA Compiler Engineer}
{Intel}{Toronto ON}{}
{\begin{itemize}
    %\item Worked on the FPGA backend for the Intel oneAPI C++ compiler, which compiles high level \textbf{SYCL} or \textbf{OpenCL} code to an executable where a CPU host can execute kernels on an FPGA
    \item Designed a feature to generate Avalon-based \textbf{RTL} interface for compute kernels that includes registers to control and monitor hardware interrupts, ensuring usability for customers developing device drivers by engaging with FAEs for early feedback
    \item Created and troubleshooted FPGA-specific \textbf{LLVM} loop optimization passes in \textbf{C++} to improve throughput and area usage for user designs written in \textbf{SYCL} and \textbf{OpenCL}, improving performance by 15\% on a user benchmark suite
    \item Debugged complex issues across the hardware-software boundary, including investigating compiled binaries, LLVM IR, OpenCL runtime libraries, Quartus compilation pipelines, Modelsim simulations, and HAL functionality
\end{itemize}}

\cventry{Sep 2022 - Dec 2022}{Software Engineer}{Snowflake}{San Mateo CA}{}
{\begin{itemize}
    %\item Developed data privacy features at the SQL query engine level for Snowflake's cloud database platform
    \item Added rules to an \textbf{ANTLR 3} grammar to enable managing data aggregation policies in \textbf{SQL}, enabling customers to share data while maintaining their users' privacy
    \item Implemented compiler changes in \textbf{Java} to parse and generate code for applying policies to a table
    \item Implemented changes to a custom \textbf{FoundationDB} layer to store information about policies
\end{itemize}}

\begin{comment}
Snowflake1: Aggregation Policy Parser Stuff
basically, added a new type of policy which is an SQL object
it had to be added to the parser through an ANTLR grammar
but there was an issue with the way the grammar was factored into sub-grammars
so I had to inspect generated code and eventually refactor the root rules
into subrules in separate files
    rootparser.g:
        rule -> rule1 | rule2 | rule3;
    rules1.g:
        rule1 -> [...]
        rule2 -> [...]
    rules2.g:
        rule3 -> [...]
became
    rootparser.g:
        rule -> rules1 | rules2
    rules1.g:
        rules1 -> rule1 | rule2
        rule1 -> [...]
        rule2 -> [...]
    rules2.g:
        rule3 -> [...]
and then i was able to implement the rules for that type of policy
