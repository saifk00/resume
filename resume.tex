\section{Work Experience}
\cventry{Sep 2022 - Dec 2022}{Software Engineering Intern}{Snowflake}{San Mateo CA}{}
{\begin{itemize}
    \item Added rules to \textbf{ANTLR 3} grammar to parse SQL CRUD commands for \textit{aggregation policies}
    \item Implemented compiler changes in \textbf{Java} to parse and generate code for applying policies to a table
    \item Implemented changes to custom \textbf{FoundationDB} layer to store information about policies
\end{itemize}}

\begin{comment}
Snowflake1: Aggregation Policy Parser Stuff
basically, added a new type of policy which is an SQL object
it had to be added to the parser through an ANTLR grammar
but there was an issue with the way the grammar was factored into sub-grammars
so I had to inspect generated code and eventually refactor the root rules
into subrules in separate files
    rootparser.g:
        rule -> rule1 | rule2 | rule3;
    rules1.g:
        rule1 -> [...]
        rule2 -> [...]
    rules2.g:
        rule3 -> [...]
became
    rootparser.g:
        rule -> rules1 | rules2
    rules1.g:
        rules1 -> rule1 | rule2
        rule1 -> [...]
        rule2 -> [...]
    rules2.g:
        rule3 -> [...]
and then i was able to implement the rules for that type of policy
